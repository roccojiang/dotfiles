# Visit Webpage

Fetch and extract readable content from web pages as markdown, or download images. Handles JavaScript-rendered content via Jina Reader service.

## Setup

Optionally get a Jina API key for higher rate limits:
1. Create an account at https://jina.ai/
2. Get your API key from the dashboard
3. Add to your shell profile (`~/.profile` or `~/.zprofile` for zsh):
   ```bash
   export JINA_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
   ```

Without an API key, the service works with rate limits.

## Usage

```bash
{baseDir}/visit.py <url>
```

## Examples

```bash
# Read an article (returns markdown)
{baseDir}/visit.py https://example.com/article

# Fetch documentation
{baseDir}/visit.py https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio.html

# Download an image (auto-detected by content-type)
{baseDir}/visit.py https://example.com/image.png
# Then use read tool to view: read /tmp/visit-image-xxx.png
```

## Output

For **HTML pages**: Returns markdown content to stdout.

For **images**: Downloads the image to a temp file and prints the path. Use the `read` tool to view it. Supports PNG, JPEG, GIF, and WebP formats.
